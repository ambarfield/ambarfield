I am a current first-year Master of Environmental Management (MEM) student within Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment studying Coastal and Marine Systems and Environmental Analytics and Modeling. My interests are related to using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other data analysis tools to better inform conservation and management recommendations for marine ecosystems and species.
